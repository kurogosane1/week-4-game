#CrystalsCollector Game

Welcome to Crystal collector game. The challenge is achieve the score for the user to achieve. This was to utilize JQuery extensively to come up with a game that could work. 
The game is timed. Different Crytals would everytime randomly generate a value that should add up to the score. The user is requred to acheive the score that they see and if they are successful in getting the score. Then they win and the system would randomly create a new game. If they lose, then a message should pop up saying that the user has actually lost. 


#Hope you Enjoy it!!!
